VLF is determined to simplify the user to yield interface. With protocols in place to ensure the ever present 'pump and dump' doesn't happen. 
VLF promotes the rights to own, buy, sell, gift and invest in cryptocurrency. 

Wallets staking for VLF will be entitled to an airdrop of $3,500 USD worth of VLFTokens a week after initial staking opens. 
To qualify, ensure you are staking within a week of the launch date.
